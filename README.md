# Under the Tree

Speak out your feeling to a stranger and get one back.

### Tool:

- Front-end: React
- Back-end: Node, express, socket.io
- Bundler: Parcel

### How to play with it?

- 📖 Read the topic for this week.
- 🎬 Once you are ready, press the start button and talk to the camera
- ⏱ You will have 10 seconds limit. However, you can stop whenever you want :)
- 💌 Send your feeling to the tree, and dig out someone else's feeling from the tree (I don't recommend re-recording because your first feeling is rare and valuable. 💕)
- 🤞 Feel what others feel, synthesis it and acknowledge it. The video will be disposed to the void after watching.

### To build
